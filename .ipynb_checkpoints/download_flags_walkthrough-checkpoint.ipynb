    "This program references two external databases/tables as part of the computation process: the Mamajek \"[Stellar Color and Effective Temperature](https://github.com/emamajek/SpectralType/blob/master/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt)\" table and the [ExoFOP TOI database](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/view_toi.php). Both of these sources are imported via the ``requests`` package, formatted and saved locally as CSVs, and then loaded as ``pandas`` DataFrame objects by the functions that refer to them.\n",

    "The ExoFOP database can be expected to change frequently, as users add targets, parameters, and observation notes to its catalog of information. Although the Mamajek table was last updated in May 2024, it is possible that Eric Mamajek may make changes in the future. For this reason, it is important to occasionally re-import and re-save both databases from the web, ensuring that the local copy stays up-to-date.\n",

    "Both combined scripts——``mamajek_table_lookup.py`` and ``mamajek_table_lookupfile.py``——have two optional input parameters after the 12 required parameters.

The download flags use a ``yes/no/blank`` input system——a ``yes`` will redownload the relevant table, while entering ``no`` or omiting the parameter will simply use the copy that already exists in the local directory.
